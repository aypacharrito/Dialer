# Pacifica production release setup

## Required Vercel environment variables

- `CRON_SECRET`: long random secret used to authenticate the five-minute automation worker.
- `TWILIO_A2P_APPROVED`: keep `false` until the messaging campaign is approved; then change to `true` and redeploy.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` and `PACIFICA_EMAIL_FROM`: outbound email delivery and verified sender.
- `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: verifies delivery, bounce, complaint, suppression, and inbound-email events.
- `PACIFICA_INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN`: receiving subdomain used for private workspace reply addresses.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: AI drafting, CRM analysis, transcription, and call summaries.

Existing Clerk, Upstash Redis, Twilio, Stripe, and lead webhook variables remain required. Use a Vercel plan that supports five-minute Cron Jobs. After changing environment variables, redeploy Production.

## Provider callbacks

- Twilio Voice application: `https://pacificacrm.com/api/twilio/voice` using `POST`.
- Twilio number Messaging webhook: `https://pacificacrm.com/api/twilio/inbound` using `POST`. Assigning or repairing a number through Phone Number Center applies this automatically.
- Twilio outbound delivery callbacks are attached automatically at `https://pacificacrm.com/api/twilio/messages/status`.
- Resend webhook: `https://pacificacrm.com/api/email/webhook`; subscribe to received, delivered, bounced, complained, and suppressed email events.

## Turn on a customer workspace

1. Open **Owner Settings → Launch Control** and finish every item marked Setup.
2. Complete business identity, mailing address, callback number, and email identity.
3. Assign a phone number and finish Trust Hub, SHAKEN/STIR, CNAM, Voice Integrity, and A2P where applicable.
4. Open **Pipeline → Automation Studio**, review each prompt and delay, then enable Autopilot.
5. Record SMS/email permission only when the customer has documented consent. DNC, STOP, unsubscribe, bounces, complaints, replies, appointments, and closed records suppress automation.
6. Add team members only after they create a Pacifica sign-in. Their Clerk account is mapped to the shared workspace with an agent or manager role.
7. Enable call recording only after adopting an approved disclosure/consent process. The salesperson must confirm disclosure before each recording.

## Production behavior

- The automation worker runs every five minutes, uses deterministic idempotency keys, retries transient failures, and moves repeatedly failing actions to needs-attention status.
- If the preferred provider is unavailable, Pacifica can use another consented and configured channel.
- Incoming text/email replies stop active sequences while Pacifica is closed.
- Email bounce, complaint, and suppression events block additional email.
- Browser saves merge with server-side communications, replies, recordings, transcripts, and new inbound leads instead of overwriting them.
- Call recordings stream through an authenticated workspace route. When enabled, OpenAI transcribes and summarizes completed recordings.
- Launch Control shows production readiness and the most recent automation result without exposing credentials.

## Honest platform boundary

Pacifica is an installable PWA. A true background mobile softphone when the app is completely closed still requires native iOS CallKit, Android Telecom, and push-notification applications.
