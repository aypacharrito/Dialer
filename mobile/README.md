# Pacifica Expo Mobile

This folder is a native Expo / React Native client for the existing Pacifica CRM.

## What this package already includes

- Expo SDK 57 / React Native 0.86 scaffold
- EAS development, preview, and production build profiles
- Clerk native sign-in using the same Pacifica account
- Existing `/api/crm/workspace` backend integration
- Offline workspace cache and resync
- Today dashboard
- Pipeline
- Inbox from stored lead communications
- Contacts
- Lead details with tap-to-call, SMS, email, quick outcomes, and notes
- Drive Mode using the existing `mobile/src/drive-session.ts` state model
- App icons, splash, iOS/Android identifiers, notification plugin
- No second database

## Put this into the repository

The ZIP contains a `mobile/` folder.

Merge that `mobile/` folder into the root of `aypacharrito/Dialer`.

Your repo should look like:

```text
Dialer/
  app/                 # existing Pacifica web CRM
  mobile/
    app/
    src/
    assets/
    package.json
    app.json
    eas.json
  package.json         # existing web package; leave it alone
```

## Expo GitHub setting

In Expo > Pacifica > GitHub settings:

**Base directory:** `mobile`

Do not use `/` and do not use `/mobile`.

## Required Clerk setting

In Clerk, enable the Native API and register:

- iOS bundle identifier: `com.pacificacrm.app`
- Android package: `com.pacificacrm.app`

Then add this EAS environment variable:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
```

This is a publishable client key. Never put `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in the mobile app.

The API defaults to:

```text
https://pacificacrm.com
```

Optional override:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://pacificacrm.com
```

## First build

From inside `mobile/`:

```bash
npm install
npx expo-doctor
npx eas-cli@latest init
npx eas-cli@latest build --profile development --platform android
```

For iOS:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build --profile development --platform ios
```

This app intentionally uses a development build because Clerk native UI, push notifications, and later Twilio native Voice work belong in a dev build rather than Expo Go.

## Expo project ID

`app.json` intentionally does not guess your EAS `projectId`.
When you run `eas init` from the `mobile/` directory, select the existing **pacificacrm / pacifica** Expo project. EAS will link the project and insert the correct project ID.

## Native phone calling next

This package currently uses the device dialer for outbound calls. The repository roadmap correctly calls for a later native Twilio Voice phase with CallKit/Android Telecom. Do not paste Twilio Account SID/Auth Token into this app. That phase should request short-lived access tokens from Pacifica's server.

## Data safety

The mobile client sends the Clerk session token as a Bearer token to the existing Pacifica API. It reads and writes the same workspace payload (`leads`, `callLogs`, `profile`) used by the web CRM.

Offline edits are cached locally and retried against the existing workspace endpoint. The server's workspace merge logic remains authoritative.

## Pacifica AI photo capture

Signing in opens the AI tab. Take a photo or choose an existing image, tap
Read photo, review the extracted name/phone/email and queue, then Save contact.
AI questions use the existing authenticated /api/ai/crm endpoint; API keys stay
on the server. Provider outages are shown as notices rather than invented
contact details. Photos are resized and converted to JPEG before upload.
Contacts are saved to the same workspace; matching phone/email records are
reported rather than recreated. A failed save leaves the draft available.

Camera permissions require a new native build:
- npm ci
- npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
- Use the resulting install link on Android.
Use the existing EAS project and EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY configuration.
iOS requires the corresponding EAS build/signing/distribution setup.

The responsive web CRM also has Take photo / Choose photo in Pacifica AI.
That version updates through Vercel and does not require an Expo build.

Verification: mobile TypeScript and Expo web export pass. Physical camera
permissions, signed-in AI extraction and saving still require a device check.
